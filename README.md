# Arthena-Task

## Introduction

Do all of your work in a Python 3 Jupyter Notebook. Use whatever libraries you want. Follow the aforementioned software engineering practices. Your final deliverable is a "model.py" file that contains an importable "predict" function (see Step 4). 
 
Your primary task is to train a machine learning model that predicts the price of a work of art given its 19 variables. Your target variable is `hammer_price`. Use the root mean squared error as your metric.
